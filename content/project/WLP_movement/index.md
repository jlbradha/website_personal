Land use change alters the way in which animals access and utilize a landscape. We use GPS collars to quantity movement and habitat use patterns of white-lipped peccaries in order to understand temporal and spatial responsonses to deforestation realted to agricultural and cattle ranching land development.

To date, we have placed GPS collars on more than 15 individuals in the Brazilian Pantanal, Cerrado, and Atlantic Forest biomes. Each peccary is given a unique name; the photo above is Tainara, one of the first peccaries we captured.
