Tropical ecosystems regulate global climate, act as carbon sinks, and contain some of the highest levels of biodiversity in the world. Yet, they are also among the most threatened ecosystems on the planet. Thus, knowledge of their evolution and response to changing conditions is of critical importance. 

Large mammals provide an interesting angle through which to evaluate changing tropical ecosystems, as they have unique top-down effects and can directly moderate ecosystem services, plant diversity and abundance, and amount of available habitat for other organisms. My research combines techniques from conservation biology, computer modeling, landscape ecology, stable isotope geochemistry, and movement ecology to understand how large mammals access and utilize their environments and how aspects of their biology, including diet and movement, vary in fragmented and agricultural ecosystems. Therefore, I evaluate how patterns associated with large mammal diet and movement are altered with anthropogenically-driven climate and land use change.
