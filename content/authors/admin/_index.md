I am an Assistant Professor in the Environmental Studies Department at Wofford College. My research interests include tropical ecology, conservation biology, and sustainability in human-modified ecosystems. My current field sites are located in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, Pantanal, and Cerrado biomes, where I use large mammal habitat use patterns as conservation proxies for evaluating changing tropical ecosystems.
